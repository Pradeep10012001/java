Factorial In Java:

Factorial Program in Java: Factorial of n is the product of all positive descending integers. Factorial of n is denoted by n!.

example:

5!=5*4*3*2*1=120

6!=6*5*4*3*2*1=720

The factorial is normally used in Combinations and Permutations (mathematics).

There are many ways to write the factorial program in java language. Let's see the 2 ways to write the factorial program in java.

Factorial Program using loopFactorial Program using recursion

factorial program using loop:

class factorial
{
public static void main(String []args)
{

int n=7;
int sum=1;
for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
{
sum=sum*i;

}
System.out.println(sum);
}

}

output;

7!=7*6*5*4*3*2*1=5040
